# Poke-Cache

### Features
- A server for read / write of pokemon teams.
- Add & Search random pokemon sets

### TODO
- Implement random pokemon search by pokemon name
- Allow text team submissions
- Convert text teams to PokemonTeam
- Convert PokemonTeam to text team
- Would be cool to have a typechart showing what types your team covers
and what types they dont.
- Could also check against the meta and see if you cover the most
popular pokemon.
